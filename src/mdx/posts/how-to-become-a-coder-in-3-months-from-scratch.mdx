So you have decided that you want to get into coding.
This article will help you understand what it takes to become a coder.

Code, developer, and software engineer mean typically the same thing. But some people may argue that software engineers work on more complex problems that require more skill.

## There are a lot of reasons for choosing software development as a career.

1. Nice pay
2. Remote work
3. Mentally stimulating problems to solve.

## Areas of software you could choose to go into

1. Web development
2. Mobile development
3. Embedded development

## Web development (We will cover the others sometime later)

Here web development is the simplest to start with, the tools for beginners are simple and you can start building projects (even if they wonâ€™t look professional) as soon as a month into it.
I will write a detailed blog on what you can do to become a web developer.
In short, you learn these technologies (in the order they are mentioned)

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JS
4. **React (The most popular and the one I use)**/ Vue/ Angular

The technologies mentioned above are used in frontend development, i.e. Building the well-formatted text, images, and animations that you see on websites/web apps (There is a difference between websites and web apps, look it up, I will be posting a miniblog about it soon.)

Backend is involved with databases and procuring data from them.

The frontend communicates with the backend with HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) requests.

Once you learn the mentioned frontend technologies and build a portfolio of websites that look professional enough, you are a developer! CONGRATULATIONS!
This roadmap is the quickest way you can become a developer, if you don't bother with the backend you can speed up your journey by a lot!
