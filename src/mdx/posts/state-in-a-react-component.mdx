Let’s take the example of a Car.
This might be a state for the object Car - 

```js
{
“passengers”: [”Amy”, “Sheldon”, “Penny”],
“isOn”: false,
“fuel”: ”80%”,
“make”: “VW”,
}
```

## State in class-based components

```jsx
import React, { Component } from "react";

export default class Car extends Component{
	state = {
			“passengers”: [”Amy”, “Sheldon”, “Penny”],
			“isOn”: false,
			“fuel”: 80,
			“make”: “VW”,
	}

//To update the state
this.setState({isOn:true});

//To update the state based on the previous state, you can pass a function to
//this.setState(). The function has access to the previous state.
this.setState((prev)=>{fuel:prev.fuel-10});

//We use the render method to render HTML in a class component
render(
		<>
			<p>Is Engine On? - {isOn}</p>
			<p>Fuel - {fuel}</p>

			{/* You can use the map method to render an array. */}
			{passengers.map((psg)=><p>{psg}</p>)}
		</>
)

}
```

## State in function-based components

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

export default function Car(){
	const [passengers, setPassengers] = useState([”Amy”, “Sheldon”, “Penny”]);
	const [isOn, setIsOn] = useState(false);
	const [fuel, setFuel] = useState(80);
	const [make, setMake] = useState("VW");
	
	// This is the useState hook. It returns an array of which the first variable
	// is the state while the second one is the setter of the state

	//Now if you want to change the state of "isOn"
	setIsOn(true);
	//As simple as that!
	
	//In a function based component you can simply return the HTML to be rendered
	return(
		<>
			<p>Is Engine On? - {isOn}</p>
			<p>Fuel - {fuel}</p>

			{/* You can use the map method to render an array. */}
			{passengers.map((psg)=><p>{psg}</p>)}
		</>
	)

}
```

📌 React has this cool feature called 🔥hot reloading, so if you modify the state of a React component. The component changes its content without reloading the page!

That’s all you need to understand the React state.
