Let’s build your first react project. A Todo list. Not as simple as “Hello world” and not as complex as an e-commerce app.

1. Install node.js
2. Run this command, `npx create-react-app todo-list`

This will create an app named todo-list for you.

1. Open this app’s folder with VSCode or your favorite editor.
2. Run this command, `npm run start`

This will start the react development server on localhost:3000

1. Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

TA! DA! That’s your react app!

Now you can start to build a to-do list component. But there are a few react concepts you need to understand before you start writing your code. State, Props, Functional and Class-based components, Hooks.

So let’s learn ‘em quick and get on with the app.
