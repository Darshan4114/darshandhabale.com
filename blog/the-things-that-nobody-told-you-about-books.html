        It may be one of two cases, either you&#39;re an avid reader I&#39;m
        talking to, or someone who has hated books all their life. I started
        reading quite late, up until I was 13 the only things that I had read
        were school textbooks. I had quite a bit of books in my home, but I had
        no interest in reading those. They were my father&#39;s. Encyclopedias
        always got my attention, they had pictures afterall. I would wonder what
        these people might be doing staring at those plain pages for hours on
        end, wasn&#39;t it boring.

        There was definitely something these people knew, something that they
        had experienced which I hadn&#39;t. I knew that they knew more than me,
        there started the itch. I went to my school library, borrowed a book, a
        story book. I started reading it, read a few pages everyday. But I got
        bored, couldn&#39;t finish it. I just left it and returned it. I
        couldn&#39;t get why I wasn&#39;t able to read a book!
      </p>

        While this time in my life I had made a friend who used to read<em
          ><em>(A LOT!)</em></em
        >. I was fascinated by how he could finish 500-800 paged books in a
        single day. This person was on a whole new level, he didn&#39;t borrow a
        single book at a time, he borrowed a dozen! Sometimes I had to carry
        some of them. Our librarian was lovely to believe him and allow him to
        issue books on other student&#39;s library cards.

        We admire people on the basis of who we are. Perhaps I was seeing myself
        in him, I wanted to be like him. Though I never issued a dozen books
        from the library.
