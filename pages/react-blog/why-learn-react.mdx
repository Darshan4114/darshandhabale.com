Developers and soon-to-be developers this is a blog series on learning React.
And this is the first blog, so I want to give you reasons why you should learn React.

Letâ€™s keep this real short-

1. React is popular.
If you are seeking employment in whatever form as a developer, a technology that is popular makes your job search that much easier.
2. React has a mild learning curve.
If you know HTML - CSS and JS you can pick up React next and make your first to-do list in a day.
3. React is here to stay
There are a lot of other frameworks, but the trend favors React. So if you are skilled in this library/ framework you are guaranteed to be relevant for at least the next 5-6 years.
